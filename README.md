# SpeechFlow
SpeechFlow is a DialogFlow webhook, hosted on [heroku](https://speechflow.herokuapp.com).
SpeechFlow allows users connected with our [Presentation Assistant App](https://github.com/ditsky/PresentationAssistant) to connect their phone with their laptop to control a lecture with their voice

To talk to SpeechFlow on google assistant say "talk to speech flow" and (once the app is released fully) you should be able to use it to control your laptop with voice commands. For full instructions on how to use the app, go to the Presentation Assistant repository or the heroku link above.
